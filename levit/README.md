# LEVIT — womenswear storefront

Static e-commerce front end for the LEVIT womenswear brand, served at `/levit`.
No build step: open `levit/index.html` through any static server.

```bash
cd levit && python3 -m http.server 8080
```

## Design system (taken from the logo)
- **Sand** `#D8C2AA` ground and **ink** `#0B0907` wordmark come from the logo; Playfair Display (a high-contrast serif close to the logo) + Jost for UI text
- Supporting accents so the page is not all beige: sage, lilac (from the poster flowers), blush, butter, forest green and wine (from the window dress); the hero background follows the chosen colourway
- **Rust** `#A8531E` from the knit, **gold** `#E7CD8B` from the boutique sign glow
- Arch frames echo the alcoves in the lookbook photography

## What's inside
- **Hero: minimal.** A white hero with a short headline, one button and a tall arch of your photos that crossfades slowly between three looks (each links to its product, or to the boutique). On load the headline lines rise out of their masks and the arch opens; the images drift in slowly and a small badge turns. It is plain HTML and CSS with a few lines of JS in `js/app.js` for the slideshow (pauses on hover and when the tab is hidden, and is static for reduced motion). Swap the looks by editing the three `.hm__slide` figures in `index.html`.
- `js/garments.js` / `js/products.js` — catalogue (INR) and the tintable hanger illustrations used in the grid
- `js/app.js` — filters, quick view, bag drawer, simulated checkout, search, wishlist (bag and wishlist persist in `localStorage`)
- `fonts/` — self-hosted WOFF2

Checkout is a demo: no payment is taken and nothing is sent anywhere.
Replace the illustrations with product photography by adding a `photo` path to a product in `products.js`.
